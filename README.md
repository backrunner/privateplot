> This project is built mainly for my personal usage, it will not accept feature requests about theme customization.

### To deploy an instance

1. Modify the variables in `src/consts.ts`.
2. Create a D1 database on Cloudflare.
3. Copy `wrangler.toml.tmpl` as `wrangler.toml`, fill the database ids and internal auth token.
4. Run `npm run db:migrate:prod`, `npm run deploy` sequentially.
